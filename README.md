# Accessible E-Commerce Platform for Visually Impaired  
### Using Voice Commands and AI-Based Navigation

## Project Description
The Accessible E-Commerce Platform for Visually Impaired is an AI-driven web application designed to enable visually impaired users to independently browse, search, and purchase products using voice commands. The system replaces traditional visual navigation with intelligent voice-based interaction, improving accessibility, usability, and digital inclusion.

## About
The Accessible E-Commerce Platform for Visually Impaired integrates speech recognition, Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning, and voice-based navigation to overcome accessibility challenges in conventional e-commerce systems.  

Traditional e-commerce platforms rely heavily on graphical user interfaces, images, icons, and mouse-based navigation, which creates major barriers for visually impaired users. Although screen readers provide limited support, they often fail to offer smooth navigation, contextual understanding, and secure interaction.

This project introduces a fully voice-driven solution where users can interact with the system through natural spoken commands. Speech recognition converts voice input into text, NLP identifies user intent, and AI-based navigation guides users step-by-step through the platform. The system also integrates personalized product recommendations and secure voice biometric authentication to ensure both usability and safety.
